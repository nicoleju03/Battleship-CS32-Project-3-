# Battleship-CS32-Project-3-
I coded a detailed Battleship game with interactive classes (including Game, Board, Player, and subclasses of Player) and complex functionality. I utilized data structures like vectors and arrays to store and update information about game objects. I designed a "GoodPlayer" class, incorporating Battleship techniques to maximize the player's win rate. In particular, I placed ships with a recursive algorithm to spread them out best as possible, and recommended attacks in a "breadth-first" manner based on previous attacks to maximize hits.

See the report document for a more detailed description and pseudocode.
